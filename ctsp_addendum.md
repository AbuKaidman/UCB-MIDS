  1. Vehicle movement logs are most frequently loose-leaf papers kept in each project vehicle and completed by hand. Most of the relevant information (date, origin and destination points, odometer readings at origin and destination, time of departure and arrival, and names of any passengers) is completed by the driver; a passenger adds their signature to the final column to certify the prior information is accurate. They are considered key sources of truth for fuel reconciliations, vehicle service requests, and nearly all vehicle-related expenditure authorizations.
  1. Fuel logs, much like movement logs, are handwritten records kept in the project vehicles and completed by the drivers. They often capture information including the name of the driver, the name and location of the filling station, the odometer reading, the quantity of fuel added to the vehicle, the price per liter, the total cost of the purchase, and the modality of the purchase (card, cash, other). When reconciliations are being done, these logs are submitted alongside the original receipts provided by the fuel vendor. When the vendor is a large chain operation (such as Total, Shell, etc.) the receipts are generated by machines; when the vendor is a smaller local firm, they are often hand-written on carbon paper.
  1. When fuel cards are in use, the vendor can often supply statements on demand. These are usually time-stamped records of transactions that show the changing balance on the fuel card; some include additional useful information such as the terminal (pump) at which the fuel was purchased.
